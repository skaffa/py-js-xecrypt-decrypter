This is a Python/JS script that can be used to decrypt data encrypted using the Xecrypt encryption algorithm.

# Xecrypt Decryption Script (Python3)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the script file (`xecrypt_decrypt.py`) directly.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script with the following command:

```shell
python3 xecrypt_decrypt.py [encrypted file]
```
Replace [encrypted file] with the path to the file containing the encrypted data.

1. The script will attempt to decrypt the data and display the decrypted output on the screen.

2. Enter any character (except 'q') and press Enter to continue to the next decryption attempt.

3. To exit the script, enter 'q' and press Enter.

# Xecrypt Decryption Script (Javascript)

1. Incude the js file in your project.

2. Call XUcrypt(XEcryptString).

Example
```js
console.log(XUcrypt(<encrypted data>));
```

Note:

This is not my own script.
I needed it for https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/6/index.html.
Initially i found [this](https://github.com/rudolfce/XECryption-crack), but only supports Python2, so i ported it to python3.
